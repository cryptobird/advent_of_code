# advent_of_code

This is a repo for my solutions, in elixir, to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

Feel free to use my code as inspiration, but don't go copying my code and cheating your way through. I don't really see any use to that anyway.

Enjoy poking around, comments as to the soundness of my code are always welcome! :)
